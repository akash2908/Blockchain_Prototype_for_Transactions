# Blockchain_Prototype_for_Transactions
A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of an immutable record of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles. The blockchain network has no central authority that's why it is called Decentralized Network and also the Blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention that is changing todayâ€™s world very fast.  In this project, we  have made a prototype of  Blockchain Technology to perform the basic tasks like transactions of information and mining new blocks in the chain.
